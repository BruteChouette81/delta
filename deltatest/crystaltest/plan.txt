Goal: create an AI based on Delta research to focus on replcating human conversation and impersonation of different personality

multi-Modality attention and connection to the real world through oracles

modify the consitionnal decoding based on the goal of the conversation

model architechture: 
    as the Delta research has prooved, the more "human information" you have, the easier it is to replicate certain personnalities. Based on those 
    research, the Crystal AI will be a transformer autoencoder that focuses on 3 feeds of modalities: text, emotions and context. A retrieval database will
    also be connected to the model as an intranet of centralized information to help coherence and truthfullness

    If context is to much as a conditon. It must be included in the Encoder input prompt (like gpt)


Data architecture: 
    3 modalities dataset must be created => 

    encoder: text, token by token         encoder: emotion signal         or conditionnal encoder w/ emotion attention

                        concat
                          |
                          |
                          |
    
    decoder: conditional decoding w/ emotion signal to decode text: must learn pattern between emotions and text
    and context which is the historic of a person that allows to make better and more personal chat

    Important: must support masks and validation
