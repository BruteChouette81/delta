Goal: create an AI based on Delta research to focus on replcating human conversation and impersonation of different personality

model architechture: 
    as the Delta research has prooved, the more "human information" you have, the easier it is to replicate certain personnalities. Based on those 
    research, the Crystal AI will be a transformer autoencoder that focuses on 3 feeds of modalities: text, emotions and context. A retrieval database will
    also be connected to the model as an intranet of centralized information to help coherence and truthfullness
